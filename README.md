This Python script automates the process of encoding username and password combinations into base64 format. The utility of this script can be described as follows:
Functionality Overview:

    File Reading:
        The script first reads two text files (Usernames_CISCO.txt and Passwords_CISCO.txt), extracting the usernames and passwords into separate lists. Each line in these files is treated as a username or a password.

    Base64 Encoding:
        It then generates all possible combinations of usernames and passwords (one from each list), and each combination is encoded in base64 format. Base64 encoding is often used to encode binary data into ASCII characters, making it suitable for storage and transmission over text-based protocols.

    Output:
        After encoding all combinations, the script writes the resulting base64-encoded strings into a new file (user-pass_BASE64.txt), with each encoded combination on a new line. The process of base64 encoding is performed by joining the username and password with a colon (:) between them, converting this string to bytes, and then encoding it to base64.

    Completion Message:
        The script prints a message indicating that the process has been completed successfully and the encoded combinations are saved to the output file.

Use Cases:

    Security Testing: This script can be useful for security professionals who are performing tasks like brute force testing or penetration testing, where base64-encoded credentials might be required in a particular format.
    Credential Management: It can assist in preparing encoded credentials for use in systems that require base64-encoded usernames and passwords for authentication (e.g., HTTP Basic Authentication).
    Automation: Automates the tedious task of manually encoding each username-password pair and outputting them in a file, saving time in cases where a large number of combinations need to be processed.

Key Components:

    read_file(): Reads the contents of the file and returns a list of stripped lines (usernames or passwords).
    encode_base64(): Encodes the username-password combination into base64.
    File handling: Opens, reads, and writes files containing usernames, passwords, and the encoded results.

This script is efficient for generating encoded credential combinations, especially in automated workflows, and can be adapted to similar use cases that involve base64 encoding of user data.
